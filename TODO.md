## About

This file contains "pre-commit" messages intended to guide project work. The intent is to generate commit messages before any code is written, in order to create more focused code editing.

Use this file as follows:

1. Write intended commit messages here before making changes to the repository.
2. Edit repository code.
3. Commit code using the pre-specified commit message that was written in this file.

- [ ] Add a useful CLI program.
